Books speak to us through mind, our brain realizes ever single page, words and even letters to compass new information.
our mindset can be called as a snowboarding field, if you want to go from A to B you use one way, sometimes you will
need to use another way , reading book creates new patterns to the direction of B, A is still there, but you can now know
that there are many ways to reach B.
